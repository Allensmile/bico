BICO (BIrch using COresets)
=======================

This is a python implementation of the original `BICO <http://ls2-www.cs.uni-dortmund.de/bico/>`
code.

BICO is a fast streaming algorithm for the k-means problem. BICO reduces the
number of input points to a specified amount such that the k-means solution on
the compressed input set is still a high quality solution to the original data set.
BICO combines a tree-like data structure of SIGMOND Test of Time Award winning algorithm BIRCH
with reduction techniques from clustering theory.
